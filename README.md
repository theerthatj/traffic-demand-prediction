# Traffic Demand Prediction System


#  Overview

The **Traffic Demand Prediction System** is an end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts hourly traffic demand using historical traffic, weather, road infrastructure, and temporal information.

The project compares multiple regression algorithms, applies ensemble learning to improve prediction accuracy, and presents the results through an interactive **Streamlit** web application.

In addition to traffic demand prediction, the project also includes advanced prediction modules for congestion estimation, accident risk prediction, and route recommendation.
